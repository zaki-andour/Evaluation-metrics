# Metrics-from-Scratch
**Performance Metrics Implemented from Scratch in Python**

This project provides a complete framework for evaluating **binary classification performance metrics**, implemented entirely from scratch — without using libraries such as `sklearn.metrics`.

It includes the manual computation of:

- **Confusion matrix components:** TP, FP, TN, FN  
- **Performance metrics:** TPR, FPR, FNR, TNR, Precision, Recall  
- **Visualization tools** for:
  - ROC Curve  
  - Precision-Recall Curve  
  - DET Curve  
  - Error Rate Curve  
  - Equal Error Rate (EER)

##  Motivation

The main objective of this project is to gain a **deep understanding** of how performance metrics are computed and interpreted in **binary classification** systems, especially within:

- **Speaker recognition**  
- **Biometric verification**  
- Any application involving **threshold-based decision systems**

Instead of relying on pre-built metric functions, all computations are implemented manually using **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **core Python** — providing an educational and transparent approach to metric analysis.
